# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. As a project in its early days, we embrace experienced dev contributions, ideas and suggestions.  Also, since we don't have a precise path, things may change fast in response to contributions. There are, however, a couple of requests to be made upon contributions:

1. Create a new branch to your contributions
1. Submit pull requests at will
1. Write tests to the functionalities added or bugs fixed
1. Make sure tests are passing

If in doubt about anything, please contact `altsiviero at gmail dot com` and I'll be happy to be in touch.
